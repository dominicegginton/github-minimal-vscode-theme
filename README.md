*This theme  was built as a minimal alternative to [GitHub's Primer theme for VSCode](https://github.com/primer/github-vscode-theme/), it is still not finished and uses and old version of primer/primitive for color scheme values.  Since the release of version 2.0.0 of [GitHub's Primer theme for VsCode](https://github.com/primer/github-vscode-theme) I have focused my efforts in contributing to that project instead, as It already includes many of the features I needed. This is why I have decided to archive this project and drop my on going support.*
